# Flick-Blitz
Flick Blitz is a fast-paced, mouse-only reflex game where players click rapidly appearing targets before they disappear. Faster reactions earn higher scores, while a single miss instantly ends the run, making each short session intense, competitive, and highly replayable—perfect for live esports events and booth activations
